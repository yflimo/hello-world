# Machine Learning 机器学习

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Divided into **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**.

## Supervised Learning 监督学习

- X -> Y  or  input -> output  
- X-to-Y or input-output mappings  
- Learns from being given “right answers”.  
  - “Right answers” means given the correct label Y for input X.  

Supervised learning is divided into **Regression** and **Classification**.

### Regression 回归
- Predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers.  

**Linear Regression 线性回归**  
- Fitting a straight line.  

**Nonlinear Regression 非线性回归**  
- Fitting a curve.  

### Classification 分类
- Predict categories/classes from a small, finite set of possible outputs.  
- Fit a decision boundary.

## Unsupervised Learning 无监督学习

- Data only comes with input X, but not output labels Y.  
- Algorithm has to find structure in the data.  
- Not giving the algorithm the right answer for the examples in advance.  

### Clustering 聚类
- Group similar data points together.  
- Takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters.  

### Anomaly Detection 异常检测
- Find unusual data points.  

### Dimensionality Reduction 降维
- Compress data using fewer numbers.
