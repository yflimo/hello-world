# Multiple Features

- **$x_j$** = $j^{th}$ feature  
- **$n$** = number of features  
- **$\vec{x}^{(i)}$** = features of the $i$-th training example  
- **$x_j^{(i)}$** = value of feature $j$ in the $i$-th training example

**$\vec{x}^{(i)}$** is not a number,but it's actually a list of number that is a **vector**.
