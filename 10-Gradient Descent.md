# Gradient Descent

**1) Start with some w,b(set w=0,b=0) as the initial guess**

**2) Keep changing w,b to reduce J(w,b)**

**3) Until settle at or near a minimum (may have >1 minimum)**

For linear regression with the squared error cost function always end up with a bowl shape or a hammock shape.
