## Tools
- NumPy, a popular library for scientific computing
- Matplotlib, a popular library for plotting data
- local plotting routines in the `lab_utils_uni.py` file in the local directory

```python

## Problem Statement

| Size (1000 sqft) | Price (1000s of dollars) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                | 300                      |
| 2                | 500                      |

```python
# In [3]:
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])  # (size in 1000 square feet)
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])  # (price in 1000s of dollars)
```
# Computing Cost

'cost' is a measure how well model is predicting the target price of the house.

The equation for cost with one variable is:

The code below calculates cost by looping over each example. 
In each loop:
- `f_wb`, a prediction is calculated
- the difference between the target and the prediction is calculated and squared.
- this is added to the total cost.

```python
def compute_cost(x, y, w, b):
    """
    Computes the cost function for linear regression.

    Args:
      x (ndarray (m,)): Data, m examples
      y (ndarray (m,)): target values
      w,b (scalar)    : model parameters

    Returns:
        total_cost (float): The cost of using w,b as the parameters for linear regression
               to fit the data points in x and y
    """
    # number of training examples
    m = x.shape[0]
    cost_sum = 0
    for i in range(m):
        f_wb = w * x[i] + b
        cost = (f_wb - y[i]) ** 2
        cost_sum = cost_sum + cost
    total_cost = (1 / (2 * m)) * cost_sum

    return total_cost
```
